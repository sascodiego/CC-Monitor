## üìä Understanding the System

### How It Works

1. **Session Detection**: 5-hour windows starting from first Claude activity
2. **Work Block Tracking**: Continuous work periods with 5-minute inactivity timeout
3. **Process Monitoring**: Detects Claude CLI processes automatically
4. **Network Analysis**: Monitors API connections for activity patterns

### Key Concepts

#### Sessions (5-Hour Windows)
- **Start**: Triggered by first Claude activity
- **Duration**: Exactly 5 hours from start time
- **Multiple Sessions**: Can have multiple sessions per day
- **Overlap**: Sessions can overlap if you work >5 hours continuously

#### Work Blocks (Activity Periods)
- **Start**: First activity within a session
- **End**: After 5 minutes of inactivity
- **Multiple Blocks**: Can have multiple work blocks per session
- **Automatic**: No manual start/stop required

### Status Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| ‚úÖ RUNNING | System is active and monitoring |
| üî• DETECTED | Real user activity detected |
| üí§ IDLE | No activity, but monitoring |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è APPROACHING | Inactivity timeout approaching |
| ‚ùå STOPPED | System not running |

## ‚è∞ Work Hour Tracking

### Daily Tracking

```bash
# Current work day status
./bin/claude-monitor-basic workhour workday status

# Key metrics shown:
# - Work start/end times
# - Total time worked
# - Productivity percentage
# - Goal progress (vs 8h target)
# - Session and work block info
# - Peak productivity hours
```

### Understanding Metrics

#### Productivity Calculation
- **Active Time**: Time with Claude activity
- **Total Time**: Time since work started
- **Efficiency**: (Active Time / Total Time) √ó 100

#### Goal Progress
- **Default Target**: 8 hours per day
- **Progress**: (Hours Worked / Target) √ó 100
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete | üïê In Progress | ‚ö†Ô∏è Behind

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Time Patterns

The system recognizes different work patterns:

#### Work Schedule Types
- **Early Bird**: Start before 8 AM
- **Standard**: 9 AM - 5 PM schedule
- **Night Owl**: Heavy activity after 6 PM
- **Flexible**: Irregular but consistent patterns

#### Peak Hours Detection
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identifies most productive times
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns your optimal work periods
- **Recommendations**: Suggests scheduling important work during peaks

### Activity Classification

#### Real vs Background Activity
- **POST Requests**: Real user interactions (prompts, conversations)
- **GET Requests**: Background operations (health checks, metrics)
- **Connection Patterns**: Distinguishes active vs idle connections

#### Smart Timeout Handling
- **5-Minute Rule**: Work blocks end after 5 minutes of inactivity
- **Session Continuity**: Sessions continue even during breaks
- **Automatic Resume**: New activity automatically starts new work blocks

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No active work session detected"
**Solution**: Start using Claude CLI. The system only tracks when Claude is active.

#### "Enhanced Daemon: STOPPED"  
**Solution**: 
```bash
sudo ./bin/claude-daemon-enhanced
```

#### Inaccurate time tracking
**Causes**:
- Multiple Claude instances
- Network connectivity issues
- System clock changes

**Solution**:
```bash
# Restart daemon
sudo pkill -f claude-daemon
sudo ./bin/claude-daemon-enhanced
```

#### Status file permissions
**Solution**:
```bash
sudo chmod 644 /tmp/claude-monitor-status.json
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Verbose output
./bin/claude-monitor-basic status --verbose

# Debug daemon (run in foreground)
sudo ./bin/claude-daemon-enhanced --debug
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
# Check recent activity
tail -f /var/log/claude-monitor/daemon.log

# Search for errors
grep -i error /var/log/claude-monitor/daemon.log

# Monitor process detection
grep -i "process" /var/log/claude-monitor/daemon.log
```
