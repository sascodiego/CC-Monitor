Intelligent compaction preserving vibe flow and sector context:

1. PRE-COMPACT SNAPSHOT:
   ```markdown
   PRESERVING:
   - Current file: [path] line [number]
   - Active sector: [sector]
   - Working on: [specific task]
   - Key patterns: [list from DECISION_CACHE]
   - Sector rules: [boundaries]
   ```

2. GIT SAFETY:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "WIP: Pre-compact checkpoint - [sector]"
   ```

3. INTELLIGENT COMPACT:
   ```
   /compact "MUST PRESERVE:
   - Project rules from CLAUDE.md
   - Sector [name] boundaries and rules  
   - Current implementation in [file]:[line]
   - Patterns discovered: [specific list]
   - Decision: [key architecture decisions]
   - Working on: [exact task description]"
   ```

4. IMMEDIATE CONTEXT RESTORATION:
   ```
   SILENT RELOAD (no output):
   - CLAUDE.md (rules)
   - Current file from line [X]
   - SECTOR_PLAN.md (boundaries)
   - Last entry from DECISION_CACHE.md
   ```

5. SEAMLESS CONTINUATION:
   ```
   // Don't announce the compact, just continue
   // User should barely notice it happened
   Continue implementing [exact task]...
   ```

6. POST-COMPACT HEALTH:
   ```markdown
   Token usage: [before]% → [after]%
   Context preserved: ✓
   Sector maintained: ✓
   Position restored: ✓
   ```

7. Reload to your context rules in CLAUDE.md
