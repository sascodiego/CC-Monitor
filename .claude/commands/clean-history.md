Clean git history by squashing WIP commits:

1. IDENTIFY WIP COMMITS:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline | grep "WIP"
   ```

2. INTERACTIVE REBASE:
   ```bash
   # Find base commit before WIPs
   git rebase -i [base-commit]
   
   # Mark WIPs as 'squash' or 'fixup'
   # Keep semantic commits as 'pick'
   ```

3. CLEAN COMMIT MESSAGES:
   - Remove WIP prefixes
   - Combine related changes
   - Maintain sector boundaries

4. VERIFY HISTORY:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10
   # Should show clean, semantic commits
   # One commit per sector/feature
   ```

5. FORCE PUSH (if needed):
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

Result: Clean, professional git history
