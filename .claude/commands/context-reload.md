Emergency context recovery without losing momentum:

1. RAPID STATE RECOVERY:
   ```
   Read in 5 seconds:
   1. Last 3 lines of ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md
   2. Current git branch and last commit
   3. Active sector from SECTOR_PLAN.md
   4. Current file from cursor position
   ```

2. IMMEDIATE RESUME:
   ```
   "Resuming [task] in [sector] at [file]:[line]"
   // Jump directly back to coding
   ```

3. NO CEREMONY:
   Don't explain what was loaded
   Don't ask for confirmation
   Just continue working
