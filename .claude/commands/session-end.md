Gracefully close vibe coding session:

1. Complete any partial code blocks or thoughts
2. Run final tests/validation if code was changed
3. Generate session summary:
   - Tasks completed: [list with checkmarks]
   - Patterns established: [list]
   - Decisions made: [list]
   - Files modified: [list]
   - Sectors worked: [list]
   - Next session should start with: [specific task]
   
4. Update ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md with:
   - Clean stopping point
   - Next logical task
   - Any unresolved questions
   - Active sector state
   
5. Append to SESSION_LOG.md:
   ```
   [HH:MM] SESSION_END
   Duration: [calculated]
   Completed: [count] tasks
   Files touched: [count]
   Sectors: [list]
   Context resets: [count]
   Efficiency score: [high/medium/low based on resets]
   ```
   
6. Save everything, confirm: "Session saved. Next time: [next task]"
