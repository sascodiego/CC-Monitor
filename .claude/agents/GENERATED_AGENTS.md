### 4. üß™ integration-testing-specialist
**Purpose**: Comprehensive test coverage and regression prevention  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Important for long-term stability  
**Key Responsibilities**:
- Create end-to-end test scenarios
- Build regression test suite
- Design test fixtures and data generators
- Establish CI/CD testing pipeline

**Immediate Actions**:
- Test complete activity lifecycle
- Add tests for timeout scenarios
- Create data flow validation tests

---

### 5. ‚ö° performance-optimization-specialist
**Purpose**: System performance and efficiency  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Required for production readiness  
**Key Responsibilities**:
- Achieve <10ms hook execution time
- Optimize database query performance
- Implement intelligent caching
- Reduce memory footprint

**Immediate Actions**:
- Optimize hook HTTP calls
- Add connection pooling
- Implement activity batching

## Recommended Workflow

### Phase 1: Critical Issue Resolution (Immediate)
1. Deploy **debugging-diagnostics-specialist** to identify root causes
2. Use **sqlite-database-specialist** to fix query performance
3. Apply **daemon-reliability-specialist** for service stability

### Phase 2: Stabilization (Short-term)
1. **performance-optimization-specialist** optimizes critical paths
2. **integration-testing-specialist** creates regression tests
3. **daemon-reliability-specialist** implements monitoring

### Phase 3: Optimization (Medium-term)
1. **sqlite-database-specialist** implements advanced optimizations
2. **performance-optimization-specialist** achieves performance targets
3. **integration-testing-specialist** establishes full test coverage

## Agent Collaboration Matrix

| Agent | Works With | Collaboration Focus |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| sqlite-database | daemon-reliability | Database operation safety |
| sqlite-database | performance-optimization | Query optimization |
| debugging-diagnostics | All agents | Issue identification |
| daemon-reliability | integration-testing | Failure scenario testing |
| performance-optimization | integration-testing | Performance regression tests |

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Use debugging specialist to diagnose current issues
claude code "Use debugging-diagnostics-specialist to investigate why /health endpoint is timing out"

# Fix database performance issues
claude code "Use sqlite-database-specialist to add indexes and optimize the daily report query"

# Improve daemon reliability
claude code "Use daemon-reliability-specialist to implement proper graceful shutdown"

# Create comprehensive tests
claude code "Use integration-testing-specialist to create end-to-end tests for activity processing"

# Optimize performance
claude code "Use performance-optimization-specialist to achieve <10ms hook execution"
```

## Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ **Issue Resolution**: All timeout issues resolved
- ‚úÖ **Data Consistency**: 100% of activities appear in reports
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: <10ms hook, <100ms queries
- ‚úÖ **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
- ‚úÖ **Test Coverage**: >80% for critical paths

## Notes

1. These agents are specifically tailored to the current state of Claude Monitor after the SQLite refactoring
2. Each agent has deep knowledge of the specific issues identified in DIAG.md
3. Agents are designed to work together for comprehensive system improvement
4. Priority levels are based on current critical issues affecting production

## Maintenance

These agents should be updated as the system evolves:
- When major refactoring occurs
- When new technologies are introduced
- When performance requirements change
- When new issues are identified
